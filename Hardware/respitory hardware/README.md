# Respitory hardware: Howland pump
A howland pump is used to measuring respitory rate. 

## Principle of action
Provided with an a voltage source it will generate an ac-current which can be applied to the human body to measure its body impedance.
Breathing causes change in body impedance (at certain parts of the body). These changes can be measured by measuring the change in voltage.
